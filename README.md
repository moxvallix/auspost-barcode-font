# AuspostFourState
This font is an implementation of the Australian Post Four State Barcode.
It replaces the characters '0', '1', '2', and '3' with their corresponding barcode bars.

I created this font as I could not find an implementation provided by Australian Post themselves.
I referenced [this guide](https://auspost.com.au/content/dam/auspost_corp/media/documents/customer-barcode-technical-specifications-aug2012.pdf) in order to get the specifics.

Listed in this repo is the FontForge project file, as well as a [fonts/](fonts/) directory, containing a '.otf', a '.ttf' and a '.woff2'.

The releases page on Github will also have a zip file to download containing all three generated font files.

The font is licensed under the [OFL](OFL.md).
